# Soccer Teams

Created for Web Development and Cybersecurity. This is a ruby on rails application that will allow users to create a soccer team and then other users can join the team. You will be able to view the stats of the team such as other users', name, email jersey number, hometown, and position.

Users create a team and are the coach. They could create as many teams as they would like to manage. The coach specifies the team name and the homefield of the team. The coach's name also is attached with the team. Other users are then able to join a team when signing up and can change their team under their profile settings. Users are only able to join one team. Users will be able to view the teams, players, and stats for other team.An Administrator has the ability to remove users and has a slightly different UI. If you do not have an account you will not be able to view the teams.

This application is for anyone who wants to try to manage their soccer team and players. This application will alleviate some of the disorganization that comes with running soccer teams.
